Hi, I’m @SimoneRitt. Nice to meet you! 

A few things about me:
- I have experience in Python, Java, R, and SQLite.
- I’m interested in Data Science.
- My current passion is Natural Language Processing, but I always try to keep an open mind when learning new techniques.

You can reach me at sritt344@gmail.com

Thanks for stopping by!
